        "description": "Franz Liszt (Hungarian: Liszt Ferencz, in modern usage Liszt Ferenc 22 October 1811 \u2013 31 July 1886) was a prolific 19th-century Hungarian composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor, music teacher, arranger, organist, philanthropist, author, nationalist and a Franciscan tertiary during the Romantic era.\n\nPlease support my channel:\nhttps://ko-fi.com/bartjebartmans\n\nDante Symphony: Eine Symphonie zu Dante\u2019s Divina Commedia (1855-56 based on sketches from 1839 and 1847\u201348)\nDedication: Richard Wagner\n\n1. Inferno (0:00)\n2. Purgatorio (21:32)\n3. Magnificat (42:22)\n\nDamenchor des Rundfunkchors Berlin and Berliner Philharmoniker conducted by Daniel Barenboim\nLive recording Elatus\n\nA Symphony to Dante's Divine Comedy, S.109, or simply the \"Dante Symphony\", is a program symphony. Written in the high romantic style, it is based on Dante Alighieri's journey through Hell and Purgatory, as depicted in The Divine Comedy. It was premiered in Dresden in November 1857, with Liszt himself conducting, and was unofficially dedicated to the composer's friend and future son-in-law Richard Wagner. \n\nSome critics have argued that the Dante Symphony is not so much a symphony in the classical sense as it is two descriptive symphonic poems. Regardless, Dante consists of two movements, both in a loosely structured ternary form with little use of thematic transformation.\n\nLiszt put the final touches to the symphony in the autumn of 1857. The premiere of the work took place at the Hoftheater in Dresden on 7 November 1857. The performance was an unmitigated disaster due to inadequate rehearsal; Liszt, who conducted the performance, was publicly humiliated. Nevertheless, he persevered with the work, conducting another performance (along with his symphonic poem Die Ideale and his second piano concerto) in Prague on 11 March 1858. Princess Carolyne prepared a programme for this concert to help the audience follow the unusual form of the symphony.\n\nLike his symphonic poems Tasso and Les pr\u00e9ludes, the Dante Symphony is an innovatory work, featuring numerous orchestral and harmonic advances: wind effects, progressive harmonies that generally avoid the tonic-dominant bias of contemporary music, experiments in atonality, unusual key signatures and time signatures, fluctuating tempi, chamber-music interludes, and the use of unusual musical forms. The Symphony is also one of the first to make use of progressive tonality, beginning and ending in the radically different keys of D minor and B major, respectively, anticipating its use in the symphonies of Gustav Mahler by forty years.",

        "description": "This new recording presents the three complete piano sonatas, the numbers 3-4-5, as well as two beautiful Suites Anciennes, which contain baroque dance forms in romantic disguise.\n\nOnline purchase or streaming (Spotify, iTunes, Amazon Music, Deezer, Google Play): https://PianoClassics.lnk.to/AlbenizPianoSonataID\nMore Information: https://www.piano-classics.com/articles/a/albeniz-piano-sonata-nos-3-4-5-suite-ancienne-nos-1-2/\n\nComposer: Isaac Alb\u00e9niz\nArtist: Sebastian Stanley (piano)\n\nThis album contains the Piano Sonata Nos. 3, 4, 5 and Suite Ancienne Nos. 1, 2 by Alb\u00e9niz, presented by Piano Classics, a label of Brilliant Classics.\n\nIsaac Alb\u00e9niz\u2019 most famous work is undoubtedly his suite Iberia, a landmark of Spanish culture and the perfect example of \u201cEspa\u00f1olismo\u201d, the fusing of folkloristic elements in romantic music. Alb\u00e9niz wrote seven piano sonatas during the 1880s, but only Nos. 3, 4, and 5 survive as complete works. As with so much of his output they are now better known in the form of guitar transcriptions \u2013 at least for Nos. 3 and 5 \u2013 but the piano originals show the same fantastical imagination and romantic temperament as his masterpiece Iberia, while conforming to a more conventionally Classical form. Their craftsmanship in harmony, scoring, and voice-leading are beyond reproach, but it is the lyric sweep and often playful touches of harmony that secure their place on the fringes of the repertoire.\n\nAs a pianist, Alb\u00e9niz was a noted interpreter of 18th-century music \u2013 not only Bach and Scarlatti but also Handel, Couperin and Rameau \u2013 at a time when such music was often disparaged as dryly academic or old- fashioned. The Suites anciennes are an early example of musical neoclassicism, comprising suites of gavottes, minuets, sarabandes and chaconnes in his own tribute to the Baroque era. But then the minuets, rondos and well-worked counterpoint to be enjoyed in the three sonatas also belong to an earlier era. The Fourth is a particular highlight, establishing Alb\u00e9niz as the leading Spanish composer of keyboard sonatas since Antonio Soler, but the others are every bit its equal in raftsmanship and elegance.\n\nSebastian Stanley is a British pianist who has specialised in the piano music of Spain, making well-received recordings of the Danzas Espanolas and Goyescas by Granados. This is his debut album on Brilliant Classics, enhanced by booklet notes by the noted authority on Spanish piano music, Walter A. Clark.\n\nSocial media:\nFacebook: https://PianoClassics.lnk.to/FacebookID\nInstagram: https://brilliant-classics.lnk.to/InstagramID\n\nBrilliant Classics:\nFacebook: https://brilliant-classics.lnk.to/FacebookID\nSpotify: https://brilliant-classics.lnk.to/SpotifyID\nInstagram: https://brilliant-classics.lnk.to/InstagramID\n\nTracklist:\n\nPiano Sonata No. 3 in A-Flat Major, Op. 68:\n0:00:00 I.
